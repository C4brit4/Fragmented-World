==Compressed Flag Cache Instalation== 

1 - Install and run FGW normally one time, 
2 - Copy the "CompressedFlagCache.zip" file from this folder
3 - Go to your flag cache folder, at "Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria II\FGW\gfx\flags"
4 - Paste the "CompressedFlagCache.zip" file you copied inside said folder
5 - Unpack the contents of the .zip into the /flags folder, replacing any file

Expect your game to crash at the couple times you start the mod after adding the flags, that's normal, it can happen up to 6 times.

Maybe you think that this is unnecesary, but if you don't have a good pc, the performance improves a lot.

I recomend you to put all files of this mod in the fgw folder, but you can also run it selecting the two mods at the same time.
